      "THE RISE and rise of the Australian strawberry, raspberry and blackberry industries has seen the sectors redouble their international trade focus, with the release of a dedicated export plan to grow their global presence over the next 10 years.\n",
      "Driven by significant grower input, the Berry Export Summary 2028 maps the sectors’ current position, where they want to be, high-opportunity markets and next steps.\n",
      "Hort Innovation trade manager Jenny Van de Meeberg said the value and volume of raspberry and blackberry exports rose by 100 per cent between 2016 and 2017. She said the Australian strawberry industry experienced similar success with an almost 30 per cent rise in export volume and a 26 per cent rise in value to $32.6M over the same period.\n",
      "“Australian berry sectors are in a firm position at the moment,” she said. “Production, adoption of protected substrate cropping, improved genetics and an expanding geographic footprint have all helped put Aussie berries on a positive trajectory.\n",
      "“We are seeing a real transition point. Broad industry interest and a strong commercial appetite for export market development combined with the potential to capitalise on existing trade agreements and build new trade partnerships has created this perfect environment for growth.”\n",
      "High-income countries across Europe, North America and Northern Asia have been identified as having a palate for Australian grown berries with more than 4244 tonnes of fresh berries exported in the last financial year alone.\n",
      "The strategy identified the best short-term prospect markets for the Australian blackberry and raspberry industry as Hong Kong, Singapore, The United Arab Emirates and Canada. The strongest short-term trade options identified for the strawberry sector were Thailand, Malaysia, New Zealand and Macau.\n",
      "The strategy focuses heavily on growing the existing strawberry export market from 4 per cent to at least 8 per cent of national production by volume, in markets with a capacity and willingness to pay a premium for quality fruit. For raspberries and blackberries, the sectors aim to achieve a 5 per cent boost in exports assessed by volume across identified markets by 2021.\n",
      "Tasmanian raspberry exporter Nic Hansen said Australia offers some of the sweetest and most attractive berries in the world, and this combined with our stringent food safety standards across all stages of the supply chain puts growers in a solid position.\n",
      "“We have a great product, we are hungry to expand trade and now with this new plan in place, we have a clear roadmap towards driving growth,” Mr Hansen said.\n",
      "He said it is exciting to see new export market prospects for raspberries: “The more options we have for export the better. Now we just have to get on with the job of ensuring industry has all the tools it needs, such as supporting data and relationship building opportunities, to thrive in new markets.”\n",
      "This project was commissioned by Hort Innovation, and developed by market analysts and research consultants Auspex Strategic Advisory and AgInfinity. Hort Innovation will work now with berry sectors to determine levy-funded activities to support trade.\n",
      "See a summary of the strategy on the Hort Innovation website.\n",
      "For more information on the berry industries, refer to the Horticulture Statistics Handbook and the Strategic Investment Plans for strawberries, raspberries and blackberries. Growers seeking more information should email trade@horticulture.com.au\n",

      "Making the most of production\n",
      "Strategic reasons for manufacturers to keep production in the UK will be spelled out in a Government-sponsored report being presented at Birmingham's Technology Innovation Centre later this month.\n",
      "Key strategic reasons for manufacturers to keep production in the UK are spelled out in a Government-sponsored report being presented at an event at Birmingham's Technology Innovation Centre (the tic), at Millennium Point, on Thursday 27th November Based on the report \"Making the most of production\", by the Institute for Manufacturing (IfM), the presentation will be made by Phil Hanson, a leading expert from the Cambridge University-based institute event is free of charge.\n",
      "The \"Making the most of production\" presentation will identify the grave dangers for UK companies who relocate production to low-wage Eastern Europe or Asian countries simply to cut costs.\n",
      "An audience comprising West Midlands company directors and senior managers from, manufacturing businesses of all types and sizes, will hear of the unseen dangers to the country's economic future caused by exporting production in pursuit of lower costs.\n",
      "He will emphasise that exporting production not only loses jobs, but also seriously endangers the UK's innovative and value-creation capability.\n",
      "The consequences for the country's future ability to generate wealth could become very.\n",
      "Academy is dedicated to design and PLM\n",
      "Birmingham City University's Technology Innovation Centre (TIC) has gained a significant new educational role in industrial product design and development.\n",
      "The presentation will detail five key strategic factors.\n",
      "First, localised production gives a base on which to build the product and process innovations crucial to manufacturing's long-term future.\n",
      "Remote production locations significantly undermine control over vital activities.\n",
      "Latest job opportunities\n",
      "Multi-skilled, Electrical, Mechanical, Maintenance Engineer\n",
      "Maintenance Engineer, Multi-skilled Maintenance Engineer, Electrical, Mechanical Maintenance (Days)\n",
      "Job Title: Multi-skilled, Electrical, Mechanical, Maintenance Engineer\n",
      "Area: Hertfordshire, Middlesex, London, Bedfordshire, Essex,...: ...\n",
      "Secondly, close control of production means control over product and technological distinctiveness, crucial to a company achieving competitive and \"copy-proof\" market advantages.\n",
      "Thirdly, localised production is key to rapid product availability - crucial in an increasingly just-in-time-supply world.\n",
      "Rapid response is also key to satisfying fast-changing customer requirements.\n",
      "This cannot be said of products in transit on a long ocean journey.\n",
      "Fourthly, localised production provides a springboard on which manufacturers can build services and add value and growth to production.\n",
      "And finally, without local production, conversion of intellectual property into marketable product is made significantly more difficult and less secure.\n",
      "\"Making the most of production\" identifies that a significant number of companies are not taking such strategic factors into account before either outsourcing or moving their production abroad.\n",
      "Over 70% of the 100 companies interviewed expected the trend of production moving overseas to accelerate.\n",
      "A third of the respondents were also concerned that design and development activities - high value areas which commentators have regarded as an economic replacement for production - will also leave the country if a more strategic approach is not taken.\n",
      "Jacqui Smith, Minister of State for Industry and the Regions, says of the report: \"This study highlights the key strategic issues around production and innovation that companies need to master for success in an increasingly competitive global economy.\n",
      "The study also clearly illustrates the importance of making the transition to high value manufacturing which is the basis of the Government's manufacturing strategy - the first of its kind for over 30 years.\n",
      "Innovation is critical to achieving this transition and we will be setting out a clear framework for improving the UK's innovation performance later this year\".\n",
      "tic programme manager Chris Braganca is organising the \"Making the most of production\" events as part of the tic World Class Network (WCN) activities, in association with Accelerate.\n",
      "Braganca has a wealth of experience working in, and running, manufacturing businesses large and small and says of the event: \"Chasing cost-cutting as the answer to profitability might bring companies some short-term benefits, but could spell potential disaster for manufacturers through long-term decline and closure.\n",
      "Businesses with vision will see the importance of long-term viability if they take note of the vital factors identified by Cambridge's IfM team in their 'Making the most of production' report\".\n",
      "The first \"Making the most of production\" event takes place in the tic at 1645 GMT on Thursday 27th November.\n",
      "It will be preceded by a free, complementary seminar on the effective use of computerised design software, in conjunction with advanced IBM system (Catia) specialists Incat.\n",
      "The \"Making the most of production\" event will be repeated by the tic's WCN partner, The Redditch Manufacturing Association, on 4th December at Bordesley Hall, Alvechurch with Arend Jan van Bochoven as speaker.\n",
      "A further event is to be held in the Black Country in early 2004.\n",

      "many ways, they are further advanced in mobile service innovation, as many businesses are built first from a mobile perspective.\n",
      "Across emerging markets, mobile is consistently an engine of growth, but as technology evolves, the mobile industry will need to play an active part in helping governments address socio-economic challenges, enable progress and build sustainable mobile ecosystems for the future. To discuss some of these challenges, we held a panel at BlackBerry Live 2013 with industry leaders, analysts, and developers to exchange insights on BlackBerry innovation in emerging markets around the world.\n",
      "Participants in the panel included: Robert Bose and Wes Nicol, BlackBerry’s Regional Marketing Directors for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Latin America (LATAM) respectively; Leandro Melo de Sales, Professor at Institute of Computing (IC) at Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL) and Principal at BlackBerry Tech Center, Brazil; Alexander Rusli, CEO of Indosat, one of Indonesia’s largest telecommunication networks and service providers; Leon van Dyk, BlackBerry apps lab manager in South Africa; and Victor Dibia, developer and founder of denvycom in Nigeria.\n",
      "Moderator John Jackson, Vice President of Mobile & Connected Platforms at IDC, opened the discussion by discussing the significant roles that mobile devices play for customers in developing markets, including functioning as a primary source of information, internet access and general computing needs.\n",
      "Panelists then discussed the specific trends that are driving innovation in their respective regions. In Indonesia, Alexander Rusli noted the decline of mass-focused applications such as Twitter and Facebook, but great opportunity for community-based applications, such as for football communities or the fashion industry. Wes Nicol talked about the need for precise market segmentation in Latin America, noting that mobile device usage and behaviors varied from country to country and market to market.\n",
      "Another topic of discussion included the lack of infrastructure in various developing markets, which the panelists observed as a catalyst for innovation. The lack of Internet and computing infrastructure has inspired new use cases for mobile devices. In Nigeria, Victor Dibia has observed that “students primarily study using their devices, small businesses convert customers using BBM, and these new activities are creating new opportunities for innovative apps from developers.”\n",
      "Lastly, the panelists welcomed the newly announced BlackBerry Q5 device. “Do not stop releasing devices aimed at emerging markets [such as the Q5], so that the transition… to BlackBerry 10 is a smooth one and widely adopted,” said Leon van Dyk.\n",
      "Do you work in some of the world’s fastest growing mobile markets like our panelists? What mobile innovation trends have you observed to be particularly relevant?\n",
